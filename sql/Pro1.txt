Create a database with the name MCA or MScIT, followed by your student number (e.g., MCA230456789 or MScIT230456789).
Inside this database, create a table named account with the following fields:
acc_no (Integer)
amount (Decimal â€“ up to 10 digits, with 2 decimal places)
After creating the table:
Insert at least 10 records into the account table.
Use the UPDATE statement to change the amount of one or more records.
Use the DELETE statement to remove any two records from the table.
Objective: To learn how to:
Create a database and table.
Insert multiple records.
Update specific data.
Delete selected records.


==> Step 1: Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE MCA230456789;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE MCA230456789;

-- Step 3: Create the 'account' table
CREATE TABLE account (
    acc_no INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Step 4: Insert 10 records into the account table
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1001, 2500.50);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1002, 3400.00);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1003, 1500.75);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1004, 8900.10);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1005, 1200.00);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1006, 7500.00);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1007, 5000.99);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1008, 999.99);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1009, 6000.10);
INSERT INTO account (acc_no, amount) VALUES (1010, 3333.33);

-- Step 5: Update amount for specific accounts
UPDATE account SET amount = 9999.99 WHERE acc_no = 1003;
UPDATE account SET amount = 0.00 WHERE acc_no = 1008;

-- Step 6: Delete two specific records
DELETE FROM account WHERE acc_no = 1005;
DELETE FROM account WHERE acc_no = 1009;

-- Optional: View the remaining data
SELECT * FROM account;
